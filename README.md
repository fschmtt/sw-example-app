## Middlewares

### VerifyShopSignature
This middleware checks the authenticity of an incoming request, i.e. the request is signed properly.
For `GET` requests it looks up the query parameter `shopware-shop-signature`; for `POST` requests it looks up the HTTP header `shopware-shop-signature`.

The middleware stores the following attributes on the request:

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| SHOP_ID | The ID of the shop that sent the request. |
| SHOP_URL | The URL of the shop that sent the request. |
| SHOP_SECRET | The secret (used for signing) of the shop that sent the request. |
| SHOP_API_KEY | The API key of the shop that sent the request. |
| SHOP_SECRET_KEY | The secret key of the shop that sent the request. |

The attributes can be accessed via `$request->getAttribute()`.
